# Screenlite Web Kiosk with Microphone Access added

A simple Android kiosk browser app that displays web content in full-screen mode.

A fork of the original version https://github.com/screenlite/android-web-kiosk

## Key Features
- Added microphone access so this can be used with speech input
- Made the save button visible in the configuration screens for small screen devices -This is a pet peeve of mine, if you have older eyes you need a (insert favorite expletive here) microscope to view the screen when set to smaller fonts, let alone be able to use the on screen keyboard.
- Displays any website in immersive full-screen mode
- Automatically launches on device boot
- Brings itself back to the foreground if minimized
- Clicking and scrolling are disabled in WebView on TV
- Supports website rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°), even if the device doesn’t support orientation changes
- Automatic retry mechanism with exponential backoff for network failures
- Automatically injects responsive viewport meta tags
- Special UI adaptations for Android TV devices
- Hides system bars and navigation elements
- Prevents device from going to sleep
- Real-time network connectivity monitoring
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
